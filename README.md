# Second degree equations solver (in Rust)

a calculator of second degree equations, my first project in Rust Lang.

## Quadratic equation

In algebra, a quadratic equation is any equation having the form : ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where represents an unknown, and, and represent known numbers, with. If, then the equation is linear, not quadratic, as there is no ax^2 term.

### Prerequisites

You need to install Rust Compiler (rustc)

https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install



```
$ rustc -V
rustc 1.46.0 (04488afe3 2020-08-24)
```

### Installing

compile using the command :

```
rustc bhask.rs
```

now you have the executable, just run it

```
./bhask
```

## Running

now enter the requested values, and see the result :) .

```

type A value (?x^2) :
1
type B value (?x) :
2
type C value (?) :
-4

-------
delta = 20
x1 = 1.236068
x2 = -3.236068
max/min point : -1 , -5

```
